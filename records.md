*Progress and process of Omeka-based work that doesn't show up in Git history. (Most prominently, but not exclusively, Neatline exhibits.)*

- Neatline editor: add default zoom
	- Hard for people to get back to the overview that contains both Boston & Lowell like the one that shows on load.
	- Providing a button for that makes it easier to switch between views as a user, and eliminates stress of realizing there's no way to get back to the original view you had on load.
	- *NB: just labeling it 'Default View' for right now, but name can be changed to whatever is most appropriate.*
