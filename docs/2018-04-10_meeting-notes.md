*Check-in day!*

### Questions/Notes for Mike:

1. Spent the weekend looking through Neatline source files so I knew how to edit things behind the scenes without it affecting your and other contributors' ability to edit the actual content of the site.
	- Basically, have figured out how to style things without having to manually go in and change entries etc. after they've been created. Otherwise, the site would be frozen in the state that it was when I finished work, and new entries wouldn't automatically abide by the same design rules.
	- (It's written that way so it's easy for anyone to edit, but it makes it hard to figure out how to get past their defaults!)

2. This also applies to the Neatline narrative - I've attached some HTML to the "introduction" section to show you what I mean. Unless you delete the entire thing, you won't eliminate the styling attached; if you do, just copy the HTML setup first so that you can replicate it ("plug and chug").
	- Example of why: I'm wrapping all the narrative sections in their own containers so they can be styled as a set of sections, rather than a giant set of paragraphs and headings.
	- How to see: when you go to `mappinglowell.net/admin/neatline/edit/1` and scroll to **Narrative**, there is a button on the second row of the editor that says `Source`. Click that and you should see the HTML come up!
		- I've labeled the first section and section title with examples of what might be going on "behind the scenes".

3. Header menu: what links would you like there, and in what order? The rule of thumb generally is left-to-right most-to-least important.

4. Would you like to keep the same logo that you're currently using, or just use the name of the site instead of a logo? I ask because the colors no longer match, but I can change the color of the orange part of the logo pretty easily.
	- Also: happy to work with you in the future on a logo design, if we decide to keep working together.

5. Any major changes to the website on your end, or questions/comments you have for me? Don't hesitate to email with additional thoughts.
